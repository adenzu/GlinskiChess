# Glinski's Chess Variant

## Description
An implementation of Gliński's chess variant on Unity.  
> Gliński's hexagonal chess, invented by Władysław Gliński in 1936 and first launched in Britain in 1949, is "probably the most widely played of the hexagonal chess games". The game was popular in Eastern Europe, especially in Gliński's native Poland. At one point there were more than half a million players, and more than 130,000 board sets were sold. Gliński's book Rules of Hexagonal Chess was published in 1973.
